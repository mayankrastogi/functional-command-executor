Hi Mayank:
I have experienced an intellectual pleasure from reading your implementation - one can understand how someone's mind work by reading her/his code. Your implementation goes even beyond what I expected to see from students at this level. I like how you introduced the combinator andThen and used it in combination with pipeTo. I am looking forward to working with you. You got the full grade, 11%.

Thank you,
Mark and Aditya
